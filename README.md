# Mafaz Abrar's Resume

Instead of creating yet another paper resume, I decided to build and host my own! This is a 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project deployed on GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow.


For local deugging:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) 
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
